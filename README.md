*********************************
## Experiments:

Please fork : [SynthIE respo](https://github.com/epfl-dlab/SynthIE)

Download the model : [Mixtral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)\ [T5](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base)

Process the REBEL datast and run test.py

## test  Framework:

All adopt the large language model used by the 4bit quantization run. (It is recommended to use at least two graphics cards with 16 gigabytes of memory.)
